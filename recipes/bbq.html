  <p>Juiciest easiest pork skewers. I don’t see many pork recipes online anymore and to be honest, in Bulgaria pork is definitely the preferred meat of choice. We have hundreds of pork recipes, from pork stews, skewers, grilled chops, mini meatball soup, baked pork with cabbage, ground pork sandwiches, meatballs, Cevapi which we call Kebapcheta and so much more. Pork is very affordable for most people and a really fatty but delicious meat and one of my favourite. If you are not a fan of pork please feel free to use chicken breast or even beef for this recipe as well. These bbq pork skewers are always on rotation every summer and can be made on the BBQ or even indoor grill pan. They are perfect with my homemade tzatziki recipe, in pita, or with salad and potatoes. You can absolutely take them for lunch the following day as this recipe makes for the perfect meal prep as well. The longer you let these marinate, the better but you definitely don’t need to wait at all if you are in a rush. I hope you love this recipe, let me know if you want to see more pork recipes from me as I have many to share.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 pork chops — you can use any you like or even pork tenderloin as wel</li>
    <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder — or more</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dry oregano — or more</li>
    <li>handful of fresh and finely chopped parsley about a 1/4 cup</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The Preparation Method</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cut the pork chops into equal size pieces. I cut mine into 1.5 inch cubes. Add them to a bowl with the rest of the ingredients and massage really well. Let it sit for at least an hour. You can let it sit out at room temperature, if you are leaving the meat in the fridge for more than an hour be sure to take it out and let it sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before you cook it.</li>
    <li>For best results, leaving the meat to marinate overnight will make for the most tender skewers.</li>
    <li>Take each pork cube and add it onto the skewer stacking them all the way until the end. If you used 4 pork chops like I did, you should have a total of 4 metal skewers.</li>
    <li>Take them off the heat after 15 minutes, the meat should be nice and golden and charred. If you want to use an instant read meat thermometer you are more than welcome to, pork should be 145°F and it’s totally normal if it’s a touch pink and absolutely safe to eat as long as it’s 145F.</li>
    <li>Let the meat rest for at least 5 minutes and enjoy with salad, potatoes, tzatziki, on pita, or any way you like.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <p>You can absolutely make this with chicken breast or even beef as well. The longer you let this marinate, the more tender the meat. You do not have to wait if you are in a rush but an hour is preferred before you add the pork on the skewers. You do not need to use a barbecue if you don’t have one as you can easily make these on the grill. If you are using wooden skewers please soak them for 20-30 minutes in water before you add the meat on them as you do not want them to burn. I used metal skewers but you can use any. If the grill sticks do oil it up first if you need to. Cook the skewers for 7-8 minutes on each side with the barbecue lid open on medium-low heat as you turn them 1-2 times. Season everything with your heart. You can use any cut of pork like bone in pork chops or boneless, you can even use pork loin just be sure to cut them all more or less the same size. I like choosing pork chops that have a bit more fat as it makes for a juicier more tender outcome.</p>
