  <p>These pancakes are not too thick, not too thin, but tender, light, buttery, and delicious. Anybody can add water to a boxed pancake mix, but you're better than that!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1¼ cups milk</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The Preparation Method</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Sift together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in milk, melted butter, and egg until combined. Let batter rest for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Spray with cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Pour batter into the hot skillet, about 1/4 cup batter for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the sides and center of each pancake, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until the bottom is golden, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
